"""Write sitemap.xml listing the pages that ask to be indexed.

The site is a wall of cards rendered from a catalogue file, so a crawler
that only follows links sees two pages and stops. This enumerates every
address that is genuinely indexable: the wall, the local-files page, and
each game file under assets/games/ that does not opt out.

A game is left out when the word "noindex" appears anywhere in it, not just
in a <meta> in the head. Some of the files carry another game's markup
inside a script or a bundled payload, so the tag can reach the document by
a route this script cannot see. Leaving a page out costs one URL; listing a
page that then refuses to be indexed costs a warning in every webmaster
tool, so the rule errs towards leaving it out.

Deterministic: same files in, same bytes out. `tests/catalog.test.js`
recomputes the list and fails if the committed sitemap drifts.
